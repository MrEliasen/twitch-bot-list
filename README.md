# Twitch Bot List (Whitelist/Greylist)

The list of white/greylisted bots/accounts. The purpose of this list is for use with the [Ban Twitch Bots](https://ban-twitch-bots.sirmre.com/) website.

You are most welcome to submit a PR if you would like to add/remove an account from any of the lists.

## Update Sep. 19th 2021

This repository no longer serves a list of bots. Instead it now only acts as a white/greylist. The list of bots/accounts are now loaded directly from [Twitch Insights](https://twitchinsights.net/bots) on the website.

I have left the `parse.js` file in the repo, in case anyone need to build in their own bot list with data from [Twitch Insights](https://twitchinsights.net/bots).

## Greylisting

These are bots/accounts which *should* be fine to allow. You can opt in to ban them on the website if you wish.

## Whitelisting

These are bots/accounts which are generally well established/verified bots. These accounts are excluded from the ban list on the website.

## Contributing

I am more than happy to take PR's for adding and removing accounts from the white/grey lists. However please do note, it might be the account in question ends up on the grey list instead of the whitelist.
