# Twitch Bot List

The list of bots is currently extracted from [Twitch Insights](https://twitchinsights.net/bots). The purpose of this list is for use with the [Ban Twitch Bots](https://ban-twitch-bots.sirmre.com/) website.

The reason for having this list is to allow people to ban them in their channels so they do not receive subs gifted by the community.

## Greylisting

These are bots/accounts which MIGHT be ok not to ban. The list includes community bots and similar. You can opt in to ban thene on the website as these are not part of the default list.

## Whitelisting

These are bots/accounts which won't get added to the ban or grey list. These are all considered safe. These are for reference only and are not actually used in the website.
