# Twitch Bot List

The list of bots is currently extracted from [Twitch Insights](https://twitchinsights.net/bots). The purpose of this list is for use with the [Ban Twitch Bots](https://ban-twitch-bots.sirmre.com/) web-app.

The reason for having this list is to allow people to ban them in their channels so they do not receive subs gifted by the community.
